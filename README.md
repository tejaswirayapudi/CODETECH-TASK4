Task 4 Overview: Sales Prediction Using Python


Objective

The objective of this task was to develop a machine learning model to predict sales performance based on advertising expenditures across different channels (TV, Radio, Newspaper). This regression problem focused on understanding the relationship between marketing budgets and sales outcomes, demonstrating skills in linear relationships, feature scaling, and predictive modeling for business insights.


Key Activities


•  Data Exploration and Analysis (EDA): Loaded the Advertising dataset, examined structure (head, shape, summary statistics), confirmed no missing values, and visualized relationships through pairplots and scatter plots to identify strong correlations (especially with TV advertising).


•  Data Preprocessing: Selected advertising features (TV, Radio, Newspaper) as inputs and Sales as the target, applied feature scaling with StandardScaler to normalize data, and performed train-test split for model validation.

•  Model Building and Training: Implemented a Linear Regression model (suitable for linear patterns in the data), trained on scaled features, and used a train-test split to prevent overfitting.

•  Model Evaluation: Achieved high performance (R² ~0.85-0.90), calculated metrics including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² score, and interpreted coefficients to quantify the impact of each advertising channel.

•  Insights and Validation: Analyzed feature coefficients (TV typically showing the strongest positive impact), visualized predictions vs actuals, and tested the model on sample advertising budgets to forecast sales.


Technologies Used


•  Programming Language: Python

•  Libraries: Pandas (data manipulation), NumPy (numerical operations), Seaborn & Matplotlib (visualization, pairplots, scatter plots), scikit-learn (preprocessing with StandardScaler, modeling with LinearRegression, evaluation metrics including mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error, r2_score)

•    Environment:
